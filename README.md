# GetClojure

Searchable, clojure examples programatically compiled from *lots* and
*lots* of scraping. GetClojure extracts valid s-expressions from
various locations, runs them in a sandbox, and captures the value
and/or output of every s-expression. That information is saved and is
made searchable via ElasticSearch.

## Usage

Go to [GetClojure](http://getclojure.com) and start searching.

## Developers

In order to run locally in development mode you'll need to do the
following:

* Run ElasticSearch locally. Find it via your package manager.
* Run MongoDB locally. Find it via your package manager.
* Run `./script/bootstrap.sh`
* Seed the Database: `lein run -m getclojure.seed`
* Start the server: `lein ring server`
* Compute.

### Note to python 3 users

If the default python on your system is python 3, you'll need to edit
pygments so that it uses python 2. To do so, run the following command
after running `./script/bootstrap.sh`:

    sed --in-place 's$#!/usr/bin/env python$#!/usr/bin/env python2$' resources/pygments/pygmentize

You'll also need a `python2` symlink, which should exist as of python
2.7.3. If `command -v python2` returns nothing, run the following
command to create the symlink:

    ln -s "$(command -v python)" /usr/local/bin/python2
