# GetClojure

Searchable, clojure examples programatically compiled from *lots* and
*lots* of scraping. GetClojure extracts valid s-expressions from
various locations, runs them in a sandbox, and captures the value
and/or output of every s-expression. That information is saved and is
made searchable via ElasticSearch.

## Usage

Go to [GetClojure](http://getclojure.com) and start searching.

## Developers

In order to run locally in development mode you'll need to do the
following:

* Run ElasticSearch locally. Find it via your package manager.
* Run MongoDB locally. Find it via your package manager.
* Run `./script/bootstrap.sh`
* Seed the Database: `lein run -m getclojure.seed`
* Start the server: `lein ring server`
* Compute.
