# GetClojure

Searchable Clojure examples programatically compiled from lots of scraping.
GetClojure extracts valid s-expressions from various locations, runs them in a
sandbox, and captures the value and output of every s-expression. The result is
then made searchable.

## Usage

Go to [GetClojure](http://getclojure.org) and start searching.

## Project Overview

| namespace | purpose |
|--|--|
| getclojure.elastic | Houses configuration, query, and seeding from files for elasticsearch |
| getclojure.extract | Contains logic related to parsing clojure IRC logfiles and spitting out files for later consumption |
| getclojure.routes | Routes for the application |
| getclojure.server | The entrypoint for the server |
| getclojure.sexp | Logic related to running s-expressions: sandboxing via SCI, formatting and printing, and production of files for later consumption|
| getclojure.util | Everyone has a junk drawer. This is ours. |
| getclojure.views.layout | Static HTML generation via Hiccup |

## Developers

In order to run locally in development mode you'll need to do the
following:

* `pip install pygments`
* `docker-compose up -d`
* Capture the working expressions: `lein run -m getclojure.sexp`. Note: This writes to a file named `output.json` which is intended to be uploaded to Algolia.
* Set the appropriate env vars in your `.envrc`.
* Start the server: `lein ring server-headless`
* Visit [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and search.
