# GetClojure

Searchable Clojure examples programatically compiled from lots of scraping.
GetClojure extracts valid s-expressions from various locations, runs them in a
sandbox, and captures the value and output of every s-expression. The result is
then made searchable.

## Usage

Go to [GetClojure](http://getclojure.org) and start searching.

## Developers

In order to run locally in development mode you'll need to do the
following:

* `docker-compose up -d`
* `pip install pygments`
* Capture the expressions: `lein run -m getclojure.sexp`
* Start the server: `lein ring server`
* Visit [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and search.

## Thanks

* To Jean Niklas L'Orange (hyPiRion) for helping me understand what
  this string does in `cl-format`, and for fixing a related bug in the
  Clojure pretty printer: ~<#(~;~@{~w~^ ~_~}~;)~:>
* To Chris Houser for giving me a treasure trove of logs to harvest.
